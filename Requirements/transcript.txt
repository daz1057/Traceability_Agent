X-axis (Time): Progress over days or weeks spent working on an art piece.
Y-axis (Creative Output Quality): The perceived quality or satisfaction with the art created.

Graph Trend: A fluctuating line that overall moves upward, showing several dips (moments of self-doubt or perceived failure), but a consistent rise in creative output quality over time.

Key labels on graph:
- Early frustration dips labeled "I’m not good enough"
- Midway peaks tagged "Breakthrough moments"
- Occasional valleys marked "Perfectionism paralysis"

This line graph debunks the limiting belief that "If my art isn’t perfect immediately, I’m a failure." Instead, it illustrates that creativity grows with time despite setbacks, and perfectionism is a natural but conquerable hurdle in the art journey.
